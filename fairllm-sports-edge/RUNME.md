## 💬 Option 2: Interactive Analysis (Custom Input)

**What it does:** Let you enter your own odds and predictions
```bash
python3 interactive_analysis.py
```

### You'll be prompted for:

1. **Game Information:**
   - Event ID (e.g., `2025-12-01-NBA-001`)
   - Sport (default: `basketball`)
   - League (default: `NBA`)
   - Home Team (e.g., `Warriors`)
   - Away Team (e.g., `Lakers`)
   - Sportsbook (default: `DraftKings`)

2. **Odds (American format):**
   - Home team odds (e.g., `-140` for favorite)
   - Away team odds (e.g., `+120` for underdog)

3. **Your Prediction:**
   - Home team win probability (e.g., `0.65` for 65%)
   - Away probability is auto-calculated

### Example Session:
```
Event ID: 2025-12-01-NBA-001
Sport [basketball]: basketball
League [NBA]: NBA
Home Team: Warriors
Away Team: Lakers
Sportsbook [DraftKings]: DraftKings

- Higher negative = bigger favorite

**Positive numbers** = Underdog
- `+120` means bet $100 to win $120
- Higher positive = bigger underdog

### Controls:
