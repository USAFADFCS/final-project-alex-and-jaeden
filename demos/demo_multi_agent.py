This script serves as a hands-on tutorial and demonstration of the framework's
most advanced feature: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration.

We will construct a "team" of AI agents with a clear reporting structure:
1.  A "Manager" Agent: Its job is to understand a complex user request and
    delegate sub-tasks to the appropriate worker.
2.  "Worker" Agents: Each worker has a specialized role and a specific tool,
    allowing it to excel at one type of task.

The scenario: A user wants to perform a task that requires both real-time
information gathering (research) and mathematical computation (analysis). No single
agent can solve this alone, but by collaborating, the team can deliver a
comprehensive solution.

ðŸŽ“ EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
This demo automatically detects if Google API credentials are available.
- Without credentials: Uses MockWebSearcherTool
- With credentials: Uses real WebSearcherTool for live data
To set up real search, see: google_api_setup.md
