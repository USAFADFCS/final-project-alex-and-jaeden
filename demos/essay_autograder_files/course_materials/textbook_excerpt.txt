Chapter 12: Food Security in a Changing Climate

12.3 Socioeconomic Dimensions of Climate-Induced Food Insecurity

The intersection of climate change and food security reveals profound inequalities in both vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Smallholder farmers, who number approximately 2 billion globally and produce 80% of food in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, represent the population most at risk from climate-induced agricultural disruption.

Gender dimensions are particularly significant. Women comprise 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries but own only 10-20% of agricultural land. This ownership gap translates directly into reduced access to credit, agricultural extension services, and climate adaptation technologies. During food crises, cultural norms in many societies dictate that women and girls reduce consumption first, leading to higher rates of malnutrition among female populations.

The concept of "climate justice" becomes relevant here. Those least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions—primarily subsistence farmers in the Global South—bear the disproportionate burden of climate impacts. The average person in Sub-Saharan Africa contributes 0.8 tonnes of CO2 annually, compared to 16.2 tonnes for the average American, yet African agricultural systems face the most severe climate impacts.

Key Terms:
- Food sovereignty: The right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound methods
- Climate-smart agriculture: Agricultural practices that sustainably increase productivity while adapting to and mitigating climate change
- Maladaptation: Adaptation actions that increase vulnerability to climate change or undermine future adaptation capacity
