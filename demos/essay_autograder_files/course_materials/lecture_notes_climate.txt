LECTURE 10: CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

Key Points from Today's Lecture:

1. Temperature Impacts on Crop Physiology
- Optimal temperature ranges: Wheat (15-20°C), Rice (20-30°C), Maize (18-27°C)
- Heat stress reduces photosynthesis efficiency by up to 40%
- Critical temperature thresholds cause permanent damage to reproductive organs

2. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021) - Key Findings
- Global surface temperature increased by 1.09°C (0.95-1.20°C) from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020
- Agricultural regions experiencing 1.5x the global average warming
- Projected yield reductions: 10-25% by 2050 under intermediate scenarios (SSP2-4.5)

3. Regional Vulnerability Assessment
- Sub-Saharan Africa: 20% yield reduction already observed in some regions
- South Asia: 40% increase in monsoon variability (2015-2020)
- Small Island Developing States: Existential threat from sea-level rise

4. Adaptation Strategies Discussed
- Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) - three pillars: productivity, adaptation, mitigation
- Drought-tolerant varieties showing 20-30% yield improvement under stress
- Precision agriculture reducing resource use by up to 50%

5. Economic Dimensions
- $80 billion annual investment needed for agricultural adaptation in developing countries
- Current climate finance for agriculture: approximately $10 billion/year
- Cost of inaction: $1.5 trillion by 2050 in lost agricultural GDP

Remember for exam: Be able to cite specific statistics and explain causal mechanisms
